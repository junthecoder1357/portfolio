#  NHL Performance Analytics Portfolio

A data engineering and analysis project focused on evaluating player and goaltender performance in the NHL using Python, SQL, and Power BI. This portfolio piece showcases practical skills in data cleaning, transformation, metric calculation, and visualization to drive strategic insights in sports performance.

## Project Objective

To extract and analyze performance trends from NHL datasets (2000 - 2020) in order to:
- Assess goaltender performance in various game situations
- Identify offensive contributions and endurance trends among players
- Deliver actionable insights for coaching strategy and player management

---

##  My Role

As part of a team project, I focused on:
- Cleaning and transforming **goaltender** and **game goal** datasets using Python (pandas)
- Performing SQL-based metric calculations (e.g., save percentages, total points)
- Developing Power BI dashboards to visualize performance and fatigue patterns
- Collaborating on insights that informed gameplay strategy

> _Note: Player data cleaning was handled by a teammate, and I used their prepared dataset in my visualizations._

##  Project Highlights

### Goaltender Analysis
- Calculated situational save percentages (Even Strength, Power Play, Shorthanded)
- Identified consistent top performers and situational weaknesses
- Suggested role-specific training and deployment strategies

### Player Analysis
- Ranked offensive contributions by total points (goals + assists)
- Identified scoring patterns by period and shift length
- Informed game-time decisions and endurance-based tactics
